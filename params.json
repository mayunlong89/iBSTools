{"name":"iBSTools","tagline":"integrated Bisulfite Sequencing Tools","body":"\r\n##iBSTools\r\niBStools(integrated Bisulfite Sequencing Tools) is an integrated tools for comprehensive analysis of bisulfite sequencing reads including whole genome bisulfite sequencing(WGBS) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). It is not only comprised of a serial of basic tools of bisulfite sequencing reads mapping and quality control, methylation ratio assessment and statistics at single-base resolution, but new advanced tools for DNA methylation patterns (under-methylated, inter-methylated and full-methylated regions) identification, annotation and heterogeneity assessment, as well as identification and clustering group analysis of differentially methylated regions of paired and multiple samples cohorts. iBStools provides a comprehensive suite  to perform a wide  variety of bisulfite sequencing analysis.\r\n\r\n![workflow](https://github.com/methylation/iBSTools/blob/master/imgs/workflow.png)\r\n\r\n####Modules\r\niBSTools has four modules:\r\n* Bisfuiltied-seq read mapping and methylation calling\r\n* Identification of methylation patterns  of genomic reigons\r\n* identification of differentially/specific methylated regions\r\n* Basic Annotation of genomic regions\r\n\r\n####iBSTools is in progress\r\n\r\n- [x] introduction\r\n- [x] workflow\r\n- [ ] identify UMRs by employing HMM","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
